===========================================================
3. KNOWN ISSUES AND LIMITATIONS

3.1  Don't Run 3D Screen Savers and Other Software Applications 

Turn off your screen saver and shut down other applications when you use the American Idol Digital Camera software.



3.2  Don't Change Display Settings While Running the Software

Do not change the monitor settings while the American Idol Digital Camera software is running. When you start the American Idol Digital Camera software, it automatically adjusts your monitor settings to the required resolution. The previous settings are automatically restored when you close the software.    



3.3  Avoid Pressing Buttons When Connecting the Camera

When connecting the camera to the PC to download pictures, avoid pressing buttons on the camera. Doing so may result in loss of pictures.



3.4 Software may lock up while re-entering Live Mode

Under Windows ME on systems that utilize an Open Host USB Controller, the software may lock up upon re-entering the Live Mode screen after working in the Create or Share Screens. This lock up will require you to kill the application using the Task Manager. To determine whether your computer may be affected:

 1. Be running Windows ME
 2. Have the camera connected to a USB Port. 
 3. To determine if you have this type of controller, right-click on "My Computer", select "Properties". 
 4. Then click on the "Device Manager" tab at the top. 
 5. In the center list, at the very bottom will be the tree item "Universal Serial Bus Controllers". Click on the "+". 
 6. If there are entries under this that have "Open" or "OHCI" in the name, then you have an Open Host Controller.)

To avoid this issue, disconnect the camera from the computer after the application is finished downloading your photos and live mode is displayed. 


3.5 No Audio Heard In Live Screen Accompanied By Error Message

Older sound card drivers may not work properly with the software sound effects in the American Idol Digital Camera.  Symptoms consist of not hearing any sound effects as you work in the Live screen and you may see the following error message:

"Due to limitations in the currently selected sound device, all sounds are disabled in Live Mode.  Try updating your sound card drivers."

To update the driver for your sound card, go the Web site for your sound card manufacturer, download a new driver and install it.  After restarting your computer, open the Live screen again. Sounds should now work.



3.6  Starting to Capture Video Immediately After Stopping Video Capture Causes Errors

If you quickly start and stop recording video, you may see several error messages in the Live screen. You can dismiss the error messages and keep on working. You must wait several seconds after stopping a video before you start recording again. If you continue to quickly stop and start recording video, your computer may stop responding and require you to restart it.



3.7  Your Computer May Stop Responding After Unplugging the Camera

Your computer may stop responding when you unplug the camera under the following conditions: exiting the Live screen to open Create or Share screens or to quit the software; opening the collections; finishing a stop-motion animation; stopping video capture in the Live screen.  The lock-up happens when you immediately unplug the camera after one of the actions listed.  To continue using the software, you must restart your computer.  

On systems that use the OHCI type of Universal Serial Bus (USB), you can prevent this from happening by using your computer sound card to record audio, as follows:

1. Connect a microphone directly to your sound card 
2. Click Start > Programs > American Idol Digital Camera > Audio Setup Wizard
3. Choose your computer sound card from the list and click OK.

To determine whether your system uses OHCI, open Device Manager and check the Universal Serial Bus category.  The host controller device description will include the words "OHCI" or "open host controller interface."



3.8  Playing Video Clips in Windows Media Player While Using American Idol Digital Camera Software Can Cause Problems

Before playing videos in Windows Media Player, shut down the American Idol Digital Camera software. Playing videos while using our software can cause skipping audio and/or a system lock-up, requiring you to turn off and restart your computer.    



3.9  On Windows 2000, Problem with Standby Mode and Hot Plugging the Camera

If you unplug the camera while Windows 2000 is in Standby Mode (one of the Power Management settings), awaken your system by moving the mouse or touching the keyboard. Wait at least 30 seconds before connecting the camera.  If the camera doesn't work after connecting, wait 30 seconds, disconnect the camera and then connect it again.



3.10  Camera Software May Not Respond After Awakening Your PC

If you use the automatic shut-down features of Windows Power Management, your camera software may not respond properly after you wake up your computer.  For example, your hard drive and monitor can be configured to shut down automatically after a period of idleness. As your camera awakens, you may see the following message:

"An error has occurred.  Make sure your camera is connected, then try restarting the application.  If you are still having problems, disconnect your camera, reboot your computer, then reconnect your camera."

To completely resolve this issue, make sure you complete these steps BEFORE you start the American Idol Digital Camera software.  



3.11  Unplugging the Camera in Live Screen May Cause Problems

Depending on your operating system and sound card, unplugging the camera while streaming video in the Live screen can cause your system to stop responding. This requires you to restart your computer. The following systems are affected:

- Windows Me with SoundMax IDA or Riptide sound cards

To avoid this problem, you can connect a microphone directly to your sound card and use the American Idol Digital Camera's Audio Setup Wizard to select your sound card:

  Click Start > Programs > American Idol Digital Camera > Audio Setup Wizard


3.12  Very Small Selection Is Not Displayed in the PC Digital Movie Creator Clipboard

If you select a very narrow (1 pixel) section of a video clip or snapshot, you will not see the selection in the American Idol Digital Camera's clipboard on the Tools menu. The selection is too small to display on the clipboard.  However, you can still paste the selection.  



3.13  Effects Appear in Layers in Video Clips and Snapshots

The effects in the American Idol Digital Camera software work on individual layers which are 'stacked' on top of each other. Effects on layers further down in the 'stack' can get covered up by effects on higher layers.  The layers are stacked in this order (from highest to lowest):

- transitions (on the storyboard)
- filters (from the Tools menu)
- paint (from the Tools menu)
- text (from the Tools menu)
- animations (from the Special Effects menu)

For example, painted effects appear on top of animations, because the animation is added in a lower layer.  Similarly, adding a filter affects all the layers in a video clip or snapshot.  

If you've added an effect to a video or snapshot but you don't see it, make sure it is not covered up by another effect on a higher layer.


3.14  No Audio Heard As You Record Sounds with Systems Using Half-Duplex Sound Cards

If your computer uses a half-duplex sound card, you won't be able to hear sounds from your speakers as you record, nor will you be able to hear sounds while playing back in the Live screen.  You'll have to check recorded sounds by playing them back in the Create screen after you finish recording. 

===========================================================
4. NON-ENGLISH OPERATING SYSTEM ISSUES

4.1 Double-byte Windows, Screen Savers and Delayed Video in Live screen

If your screen saver has been showing for a while and you don't see video in the Live screen when you wake up your computer, wait 20 - 30 seconds.  The video stream should appear automatically.  To see the video stream sooner, you can open the Create screen or Share screen and then go back to the Live screen.



4.2 Double-byte Windows and Names of Imported Files

Files are imported into the collections using the original double-byte file name.  In some cases, this file name will be illegible in the American Idol Digital Camera software. There is no work-around for this problem.
